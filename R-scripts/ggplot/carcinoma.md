colon adenocarcinoma tissue mean gene expession is on the y axis
normal tissue mean gene expression is on the x axis. 
the line of slope 1 repesents equal expression in normal and cancer tissue

Observations:

1) there is a cluster of genes expressing more prevalently in normal tissue.  
  - this is likely smooth muscle tisue that was taken along with normal samples, and not with carcinoma biopsies(1) 

2) there are several outlier genes to look at.
